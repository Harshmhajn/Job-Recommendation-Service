# Recommendation Algorithm for Job Recommendation Service

## Introduction
This document outlines the recommendation algorithm utilized in the Job Recommendation Service. The algorithm is designed to suggest relevant job postings to users based on their profiles and preferences.

## Algorithm Overview
The recommendation algorithm employs a scoring-based system that matches user preferences with job requirements. The main components of the algorithm include:

1. **User Profile**:
    - Consists of skills, experience level, desired roles, preferred locations, and job type.

2. **Job Posting**:
    - Contains job title, company, required skills, location, job type, and experience level.

## Scoring Mechanism
The scoring mechanism is based on the following criteria:

1. **Skill Match**:
    - Each skill in the user’s profile is compared with the required skills for the job.
    - A score of 1 is awarded for each matching skill.

2. **Experience Level Match**:
    - If the user’s experience level meets or exceeds the job’s requirements, an additional score of 2 is awarded.

3. **Role Match**:
    - If the user’s desired roles match the job title, an additional score of 3 is awarded.

4. **Location Match**:
    - If the job location is among the user’s preferred locations, an additional score of 2 is awarded.

5. **Job Type Match**:
    - If the job type matches the user’s preference, an additional score of 1 is awarded.

### Example Scoring Calculation
Assuming the following user profile:
- Skills: Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs
- Experience Level: Intermediate
- Desired Roles: Backend Developer
- Preferred Locations: Remote, India
- Job Type: Full-Time

And a job posting:
- Title: Backend Developer
- Required Skills: Java, Spring Boot, Docker
- Experience Level: Intermediate
- Location: Remote
- Job Type: Full-Time

The scoring would be calculated as follows:
- Skill Match: Java (15) + Spring Boot (15) = 2
- Experience Level Match: Intermediate (40)
- Role Match: Backend Developer (40)
- Location Match: Remote (40)
- Job Type Match: Full-Time (20)

**Total Score**: 30 + 40 + 40 + 40 + 20 = **170**

## Conclusion
The scoring system allows for effective recommendations, ensuring users receive job postings that align with their skills and preferences. Future improvements may include incorporating machine learning techniques to refine the recommendations further.
